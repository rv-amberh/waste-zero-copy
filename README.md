### Getting Started

To view WasteZero (in-progress) at the moment, you can log in with the following credentials or create a new account:

### **Login Credentials to Use**

**Email: amberhall1996@gmail.com**

**Password: testingpassword**

Once logged in, you can sign in as either a volunteer or a business using the same credentials to see both dashboards in progress.

### Goal

The goal of WasteZero is to bridge the gap between businesses with surplus food and volunteers who can distribute that food to communities in need. By doing so, WasteZero contributes to reducing food waste and fighting food insecurity in a more sustainable and efficient way.

### Problem Statement
In the U.S., over 30% of the food supply is wasted annually, while millions face food insecurity. Businesses often have leftover food after events or daily operations, but they lack the infrastructure to redistribute it efficiently. WasteZero provides a platform that connects businesses, volunteers, and organizations, making it easier to redistribute surplus food to those who need it most.

### Product Features

#### Coming Soon

- WasteZero’s user-centric dashboard will soon empower volunteers to make an impact on their own schedule. Upon logging in, volunteers will be able to:
- Access all available food orders in their designated area
- Use filters for pickup times and locations
- View urgent orders about to expire and claim them
- Track the amount of food they’ve saved using data visualizations
- Invite friends to volunteer for extra kudos
- WasteZero will simplify the donation process for businesses. A designated point of contact (such as a facilities manager) will soon be able to:
  - Quickly enter orders into the system with just a few fields
  - Monitor the status of their orders in real-time
  - See when orders are claimed and receive an ETA on volunteer pickups
  - The business dashboard will also provide an overview of the business's impact, complete with downloadable reports and forms for tracking donations and sharing progress.
